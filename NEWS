0.99.1
------

The library has almost been completey re-written since 0.99.0 so too many
changes to document here. Most notable changes however are:

- Freeform geocoding, and reverse geocoding search API.
- Search results are now locale aware.
- We now use Nominatim instead of Yahoo Places API for (reverse-)geocoding.
  Not only is Nominatim a completely open service, it is also has a lot more
  data to offer.
- GeoIP server and client API. WARNING: These will soon be removed in favor of
  geoclue2 so do not use them in your application. Instead use geoclue2
  directly.
- More test cases.
- Various fixes to build and installation.

Dependencies changed:

- gio-2.0 >= 2.34
- json-glib-1.0 >= 0.14
- geoip (for GeoIP server only)
